The original FCC assignment read:

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
